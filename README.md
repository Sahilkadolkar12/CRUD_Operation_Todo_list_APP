# Django ToDo App Overview

## Introduction

The Django ToDo App is a web-based application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Leveraging the power of the Django web framework, this app provides a user-friendly interface for creating, updating, and organizing tasks.

## Features

- Task Management: Perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
- User Authentication: Secure user accounts with authentication to ensure personalized task management.
- Responsive Design: The app is built with responsiveness in mind, making it accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

## How It Works

- User Registration and Login: Users can create accounts by registering with a unique username and password. Existing users can log in to access their tasks.

- Task Creation: Once logged in, users can create new tasks by providing a task title, description, and other relevant details.

- Task Listing: The app displays a list of tasks, showing essential information such as task title, status, and deadline.

- Task Details and Editing: Users can view detailed information about each task and have the ability to edit task details or mark tasks as completed.

- Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks they no longer need, helping to keep their task list organized.

## Technologies Used

- Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- HTML/CSS: Frontend development for creating a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
